                 I am currently building my skillset in web development and exploring different technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                      <h3>Budget Tracker Web App</h3>

                      <p>
  One of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of is a <strong>Budget Tracker Web Application</strong>, built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. 
  This application was designed to help users plan and manage their finances by tracking income and spending across multiple categories.
</p>
<p>
  The idea originally started as a typical to-do list app â€” a common beginner project â€” but I decided to challenge myself by building something more practical and feature-rich. 
  Thatâ€™s how the budget tracker was born.
</p>
<p>
  It includes features like <strong>income and expense input, real-time budget calculation, data persistence with localStorage</strong>, and a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes. 
  Building this app gave me hands-on experience with <strong>dynamic DOM updates, form handling, conditional rendering, and modular JavaScript structure</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  I also learned how to organize and display user data across multiple pages, and enhanced the interface with visual elements like remaining balance highlights, alerts, and categorized lists. 
  This project significantly improved my understanding of client-side interactivity and user-focused design.

                         One of my first completed projects is a <strong>basic calculator web application</strong>, which I built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. 
                         This project helped me understand core programming concepts such as user input handling, event listeners, conditional logic, and DOM manipulation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                         The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, handles input edge cases, and includes features like clearing the display and backspacing.

                        An interactive booking interface where clients can schedule 1-on-1 coding sessions with me. The app allows users to enter their details, select a specific service, and choose a preferred date and time for the session. Itâ€™s fully built using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, with real-time updates and smooth client-side interaction â€” no backend or database required.
